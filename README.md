Welcome to the plots/ folder of the repository Imbalance Settlement and Multiproduct Balancing Energy Markets.

This directory contains the figures derived from the sensitivity analyses of the results which are presented in "Imbalance Settlement and Multi‑Product Balancing Energy Markets"
by Jacques Cartuyvels, Gilles Bertrand, Alexandros Visas, and Anthony Papavasiliou.

The plots are organised into two main groups:

1) Illustrative example (linear case presented in the paper)
2) Empirical data example

Each group includes plots for the following sensitivity experiments:

1) mFRR Activation Strategy Sensitivity Results (activation_strategy_sensitivity_analysis directory)
2) Fixed Gate Closure Sensitivity Analysis (fixed_gate_closure_forecast_sensitivity_analysis directory)
3) Forecasted System Imbalance Sensitivity Analysis (forecasted_system_imbalance_band_sensitivity_analysis directory)
4) Gate Closure Forecast Band Sensitivity Analysis (gate_closure_forecast_band_sensitivity_analysis directory)
